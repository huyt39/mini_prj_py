    "* There may be more than one different way to answer a question or complete an exercise.\n",
    "* Some skeleton code has been implemented for you.\n",
    "* Exercises are based off (and directly taken from) the quick [introduction to Scikit-Learn notebook](https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb).\n",
